# Syft Tic-Tac-Toe Coding Challenge

## DEMO 

[Demo link TicTacToe](https://alexspadlo.github.io/syftfe/)

## Commands

Running local:

 - `yarn install`: Installs all the dependencies
 - `yarn start`: Runs in development mode
 - `yarn build`: Builds all the static assets for the project within the /dist folder
 - `yarn test`: Runs all the unit tests
 - `yarn lint:js`: Runs the code linter on all js files
 - `yarn lint:scss`: Runs the code linter on all scss files

## Important:

I am using node-sass to enable SCSS modules, node-sass require a correctly version of Node to work properly:

NodeJS  | Minimum node-sass version | Node Module
--------|--------------------------|------------
Node 14 | 4.14+                    | 83
Node 13 | 4.13+                    | 79
Node 12 | 4.12+                    | 72
Node 11 | 4.10+                    | 67
Node 10 | 4.9+                     | 64
Node 8  | 4.5.3+                   | 57

As my machine is currently running Node 14, my node-sass is config as 4.14.

Git Hooks:

The project count with Husky and Lint Staged:
 - `pre-commit`: Run all scripts on lint-staged
    - `lint-staged`: Run all linters and add to commit if something be fix
 - `pre-push`: Run all unit tests

## Project structure

 - `src`: JavaScript source code of the application
   - `components`: Components folder
   - `constants`: Constants folder contains default configuration
   - `container`: Containers folder with main container that include the React Router
   - `static`: Static folder with all images and logos
   - `store`: Actions, epics, reducers and sagas folder
 - `public`: Manifest and HTML template generated by create-react-app

## Development URLs

- Home screen: `http://localhost:3000/`

## What to do with more time?

 - Focus in more Unit test as I just insert basics :) (Tests is never too much, right?)
 - Set Webpack :) (Because I like to do all my configurations)
 - Set Global variables on SASS to have a better control in the layout.
 - Maybe give a better name for the folders :)
